            // The cadence represents the rate at which TimelineView updates, and it might change many times during the viewâ€™s lifecycle. For example, running the TimelineView on Apple Watch might decrease cadence while the user lowers the wrist. Fortunately, the Cadence type conforms to Comparable protocol, and we can easily compare them.
